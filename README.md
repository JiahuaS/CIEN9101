The summary of research on PINN for discovering PDE based on given data on Spring 2024 supervised by Zhaobin Mo

# Summary
Physics-informed neural network (PINN) or Physics-informed deep learning is a new topic in machine learning. The fundamentals of PINN originated from the work of Marziar Raissi of Prof. George Karniadarkis' group in 2017 titled: Physics Informed Deep Learning:Data-driven Solutions of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations \citep{RAISSI2019686}. It was later accepted by the Journal of Computational Physics. The complete work is separated into two main parts. One is an inverse problem; one is a forward problem. In this paper, we will introduce a new method for discovering the partial differential equations (PDE) by using the PINN method, find some interesting points raised from other related papers, and further extensions on the papers we are interested in for finding new PDEs based on the dataset, and do some code realizations for my new method as much as I can.
